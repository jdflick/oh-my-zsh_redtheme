oh-my-zsh theme using red, black and white based off agnoster
#This is a modification of agnoster's theme, so leaving all the other info here:
# agnoster's Theme - https://gist.github.com/3712874
# A Powerline-inspired theme for ZSH
#
# # README
#
# In order for this theme to render correctly, you will need a
# [Powerline-patched font](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts).
# Make sure you have a recent version: the code points that Powerline
# uses changed in 2012, and older versions will display incorrectly,
# in confusing ways.
#
# In addition, I recommend the
# [Solarized theme](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/) and, if you're
# using it on Mac OS X, [iTerm 2](http://www.iterm2.com/) over Terminal.app -
# it has significantly better color fidelity.
#
# # Goals
#
# The aim of this theme is to only show you *relevant* information. Like most
# prompts, it will only show git information when in a git working directory.
# However, it goes a step further: everything from the current user and
# hostname to whether the last call exited with an error to whether background
# jobs are running in this shell will all be displayed automatically when
# appropriate.
